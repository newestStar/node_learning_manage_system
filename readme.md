The project is currently under development, with continuous changes and some bits and bobs not working. Feel free to test it if you like but don't expect it to be production-ready. If you are interested in contributing, please [join the Slack group](http://slack.nekomy.com) and have a look at the [project backlog](https://github.com/nekomy/nekomy-platform/projects/1) to see if you can pick something up.

## Getting Started

Warning! This documentation is not super stable. Post an issue if you find any trouble or something is not clear

- Install Node.js >= 7.4.0 [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)

- Install a Git client. I recommend SourceTree [https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

- Clone this repository into a folder in your computer [https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/](https://help.github.com/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use/)

- Install the dependencies using NPM or Yarn:

````
npm install
````

- Create a new project in your [Firebase account](http://firebase.google.com)

- Enable at the Email/Password provider in the [Firebase authentication providers](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/bigmomo-647f1/authentication/providers)

- Create a file called `.env` in the root of your cloned repository and add the following code. Replace the values with the ones from the project you created in Firebase:

````
FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key
FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_project.firebaseapp.com
FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://your_firebase_project.firebaseio.com
FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_project.appspot.com
````

- Update the default project value in `.firebaserc`

- If you want some demo data, import `/data/demo-data.json` into your Firebase database

- If you are going to use Firebase storage, you should give read access to everyone, otherwise only the authenticated users will be able to download images or files. In your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com), replace the rules with these ones:

````
allow read: if true;
allow write: if request.auth != null;
````

- To give a user admin rights, you have to add a field called `level` with the value `5` into a user (using the firebase UI). Once you do that, login into Nekomy with that user and you will see the `admin` link in the sidebar navigation
